IoT Based Auto-Disinfectant Sprinkler System for Large  Enclosed Space

COVID-19 created the necessity of sanitizing every corner to keep life 
secured. In conventional means, sanitization is handled by sprinklers in a variety 
of shapes and sizes. These sprinklers are either human controlled or machine controlled and does the job by placing them on the floor. The conventional sprinkling system is risky and exerts tremendous pressure on the working personnel; 
also, it does not assure of covering the entire space intended-for. The proposed 
auto-sprinkler overcomes these limitations by attaching it to the roof/ceiling and 
performs the process of sprinkling the disinfectant solution in mist form while 
being rotated at a 360ï‚° angle to ensure more coverage. The sprinkling distance is 
measured automatically using ultrasonic sensor. The Wi-Fi module in the system 
gets the data inputs from a website where the admin user can enter the start/stop 
time and duration of the spray. This system keeps a strict check on whether the 
place is sanitized or not and gives an alert notification if it has been a long time 
since the last sanitization took place. The prototype was tested and found to be 
very useful during the Covid-19 pandemic.
